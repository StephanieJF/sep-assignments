Spatial locality is a concept that items with nearby locations tend to be referenced around the same time.
In other words, it can be speculated that data surrounding the current reference may need to be accessed
around the time the current reference is retrieved. Spatial locality helps to increases the likelihood of cache
"hits" by keeping these nearby items in one place, and therefore, when an item is retrieved, retrieving the
items nearby the current reference can be retrieved at the same time and stored in a place with easier access,
the cache. This will result in greater overall efficiency in the long run by saving additional trips of going
back into the RAM to retrieve that information.
